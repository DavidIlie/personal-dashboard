# Personal Dashboard

Currently, this is a personal dashboard tailored to **my** needs. The page is created using NextJS, TailwindCSS and Typescript.

> **WARNING**: this is a development branch of me implementing all the features to make this app usable by more people than just me, due to the huge interest in this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/pzd32x/after_a_couple_of_months_of_tinkering_and_coding/)

Things that are/need to be added:

-   [x] SQLite3 integration with Prisma
    -   [x] Create all models for each table
-   [ ] Setup page
    -   [x] First page (ask name)
    -   [x] Second page (create account)
    -   [ ] Third page (modules - enable and add api keys for them)
    -   [ ] Fourth page (summary)
-   [ ] Make `/home` fetch data from the database
-   [ ] Light/Dark mode

more features can be requested by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/davidilie/personal-dashboard)
