# Personal Dashboard

Currently, this is a personal dashboard tailored to **my** needs. The page is created using NextJS, TailwindCSS and Typescript.

> **WARNING**: this is a development branch of me implementing all the features required to make this app usable by more people than just me, due to the huge interest in this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/pzd32x/after_a_couple_of_months_of_tinkering_and_coding/).
