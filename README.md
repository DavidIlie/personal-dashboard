# Personal Dashboard

Currently, this is a personal dashboard tailored to **my** needs. The page is created using NextJS and TailwindCSS and Typescript.

In the future I plan to make this customizable with an external database so that anyone can host this on their infastructure.

Things that I want to be implemented:

-   MongoDB integration to keep pinned pages there
-   Admin page to add new pages
-   Nice first time setup for the user to setup the dashboard to their needs
-   Dark mode and Light mode (for the weird people)
